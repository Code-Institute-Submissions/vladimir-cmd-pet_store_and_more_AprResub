## User Experience

### Plan

As someone who has a pet in the family, and where the pet is treated as an equal family member, I understand the struggles when you cannot find everything on one place.
This is why this website is created. The main purpose of this website is to provide all the necessary and essential products, together with other useful things to keep your pet happy and safe.

### User Stories

Reason why creating this website:

- be a place where visitor can create their profile by registering 
- be a place where visitor can login, and update its personal details (for the billing and shipping purposes)
- be a place where visitors can look for specific items for their pets
- be a place where visitors can look for new deals, clearance items, and discounted items
- be a place where visitors can search for a specific item
- be a place where visitor can at any time look at its purchase history and possibly re-order

  - An IDE such as 
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - [set up an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

#### Instructions
01. Save a copy of the github repository located at [Pet Store and More](https://github.com/vladimir-cmd/pet_store_and_more.git) by clicking the "download zip" button at the top of the page and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder. Much easier way is to just clone the repo with Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/vladimir-cmd/pet_store_and_more.git
```
02. Open your preferred IDE, open a terminal session in the unzip folder or cd to the correct location.
03. A virtual environment is recommended for the Python interpreter, I recommend using Pythons built in virtual environment. Enter the command:
```
python -m .venv venv
```
04. Activate the .venv with the command:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
05. Install all required modules with the command:
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```
06. Set up the following environment variables within your IDE.
+ If using VSCode, locate the settings.json file within the .vscode directory and add your environment variables as below. Do not forget to restart your machine to activate your environment variables or your code will not be able to see them:
```
 "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
    "HOSTNAME": "<enter hostname here>",
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<enter key here>",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<enter key here>",
    "DATABASE_URL": "<enter key here>",
    "EMAIL_HOST_PASS": "<enter key here>",
    "EMAIL_HOST_USER": "<enter url here>",
    "SECRET_KEY": "<enter url here>",
    "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY": "<enter key here>",
    "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "<enter key here>",
    "STRIPE_WH_SECRET": "<enter key here>",
    "USE_AWS": "True",
    "AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME": "<enter bucket name here>"
 }
 ```
+ HOSTNAME should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.
07. If you have restarted your machine to activate your environment variables, do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment with the command used at step 4.
08. Migrate the admin panel models to create your database template with the terminal command:
```
python manage.py migrate
``` 
09. Create your superuser to access the django admin panel and database with the following command, and then follow the steps to add your admin username and password:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
10. You can now run the program locally with the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
### Heroku Deployment
To deploy Pet Store and More webshop to heroku, take the following steps:

```
3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project to GitHub.
4. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.
5. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.
